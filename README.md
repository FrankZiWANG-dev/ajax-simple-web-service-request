# Inspirational quote generator

## Project
This project generates a random inspirational quote, using AJAX to get the data from the website "thatsthespir.it". The website uses HTML, CSS / SASS, Javascript and Ajax.

## Roadmap
Using HTML, the structure of the website was written.
Using AJAX, functions were written to pull information from the external source in JSON format and insert it as HTML into our website.
Styling was done using SASS.
Error message yet to be tested. Additional styling required to make it look more slick. Additional image to be added if no author portrait in external source.
